# Overarching function

The integumentary system is an organ system that covers the entire body. It is made up of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layer. The main function of the integumentary system is to regulate body temperature, protect from infection and radiation, perceive senses, and produce vitamin.

## Basic structures and functions

### Macroscopic structures

1. **Epidermis → barrier to infections**
    
    
2. **Hair → conservation of body heat**
    
    

### Microscopic structures

1. **Sweat glands → to regulate body heat**
    
    Sweat glands produce sweat that comes out from sweat pores, which is located on the epidermis layer. This happens when the body temperature is too high. The production of sweat brings down body temperature. 
    
2. **Sensory receptors → to feel**
    
    Sensory receptors are the yellow
