# Overarching Function

The reproductive systems of our bodies help develop secondary sex characteristics and produce sex cells.. The reproductive system produce, transport, and sustain reproductive cells known as sperm and egg cells. Through the process of fertilization, it produces an offspring that’s nurtured in a woman’s uterus.

## Basic structures and functions

### Macroscopic structures

1. **Testis**
    
    There are two testes in males. A testis is the male reproductive gland and are located outside the body in a pouch called the scrotum, because sperm cannot be produced in normal body temperatures of 37ºC or higher. Sperm cells are produced in the testis, and is described below.

2. **Ovary**
    
    There are two ovaries in females. The ovary is an organ in the female reproductive system. Egg cells are produced in the ovaries, as described in the next section. The cervix, at the lower end of the uterus, has a narrow opening through the vagina that leads to the outside of the female body.

### Microscopic structures

1. **Sperm**
    
    A sperm is a cell composed of a head, mid-piece, and tail. It is developed in the testes in the seminiferous tubules. Then, it travels to the epididymis, where sperm mature and are stored. When it’s released, the sperm travel through the vas deferens (sperm duct), which leads to the testis. Sperm require semen, a fluid that contains sperm and other substances to allow the sperm to survive long enough to fertilize an egg.

2. **Egg cells**
    
    Egg cells refer to female reproductive cells. They are produced in the ovaries. Approximately once every 28 days, oocytes, immature eggs, develop into and egg, called an ovum. Follicle cells protect and nourish the ovum. After the egg is released from the ovary, it travels through an oviduct to the uterus, where a baby develops before birth. If the ovum is not fertilized, it travels down to the uterus, and the lining of the uterus is shed. Then, it passes through the vagina along with fluid (blood) out of the body. This process is known as menstruation. 
    

# Connection to other systems

The reproductive system works with the endocrine system. The endocrine glands in the reproductive system produce sex hormones that is responsible for characteristics in male and female. Female sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, help regulate the development and function of the uterus. A female’s anterior pituitary gland produces luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which control the menstrual cycle and follicular development. 

# Differences between a frog and human

Both frogs and humans possess testis and ovaries with the same purpose, but their similarities end here. Frogs undergo external fertilization (they lay eggs) in water, whereas humans have internal fertilization (we get pregnant). Male humans excrete sperm through the penis, whereas male frogs excrete them through the cloaca. Female humans have an opening that leads to the uterus, which then leads to two ovaries, called the vagina, whereas female frogs have two separate openings in the oviducts that open into the cloaca.
